        Today I will tell you the difference between Crochet and Knitting. Everyone always gets them confused for being the same. I will teach you more about the differences and how next time you see someone
        Crocheting or Knitting you can tell the difference.

          <h3 class="center">Crocheting VS Knitting</h3>
          <p>A fun fact about what is unique about crocheting, is that it can not be replicated by a machine. Crochet can only be made
            by hand with a hook and a person making the product. </p>
            <p class="center"><s>Crochet can be made by a machine</s> NOT TRUE!!!</p>
            <p>Knittng actually can be made from a machine and done in a short time.
            They actually have machines sold to make knitting products. That is why if you have a knitted sweater or clothing, that was most likely made by a machine.
            Knitting has a nice finish to it with the product having visable V's across. The finishing work of Knittng comes a long way and looks good in the end.
